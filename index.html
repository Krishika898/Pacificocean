                     Red Algae is a rich source of fiber, minerals, carbohydrates, protein, and enzymes. Red Algae forms an important part of the ecosystem. Later on Red Algae is consumed by many living organisms such as fish, worm, crustaceans, and even humans. Until now more than 6,000 species of Red Algae have been found.
